a tag
href is an attribute

box model
- content: what inside the box it has width, height
- padding : transparent area around around the content
- border : around the padding and the content
- margin : space between 2 element , it outside the box
- fill area: every area except the margin

Best practice
- Naming use course-image instead of courseImage
- reset all margin and padding property using *{margin: 0, pad:0, box-sizing: border-box;}
- box-sizing makes sure that the margin and padding are calculated with the height and margin we set.

Child element
- access the element that inside a tag for styling it alone eg contact-form p {}
