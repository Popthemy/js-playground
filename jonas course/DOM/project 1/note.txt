DOM
> Document Object Model is a structured representation of html document.
It allows us to access html element and style with js in other to manipulate them.

We can change text, html attribute and the style

Document is the entry point to a DOM

DOM isn't JS but a WEB API that we can interact with using JS.
There are other API such as fetch, time.

Example:
> To get an element by its class
document.querySelector('.number).textContent:; use #message if it an id.

> set the content of a tag
document.querySelector('.result p').textContent

> style a tag 
document.querySelector('body).style =
document.querySelector('.guessed-number').style.width = '20rem';

Event listener are use to listen to event on the page. e.g mouse click, keyboard click
the eventlistener takes 2 args: the event (e.g click....) and the function that specify how the event should be handled
