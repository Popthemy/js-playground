OOP
creating objects in js

Concept of OOP
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

OOP in javascript : prototype
All objects in javascript are linked Prototype

Prototype contain properties and method that all object linked 
to that prototype can use called *prototypal Inheritance*

3 way to create prototype
- Construction function: techniques to create object from a function. 
  it the wau array , maps / sets are created.
- ES6 classes: modern way it uses construction function under the hood

- Object.create() : most staightforward way of linking object to a prototype object 


the diff. btw regular function and construction function is the `new` keyword
const Person = function(firstName, birthYear){
  this.firstName = firstName,
  this.birthYear = birthYear
};

const themy = new Person('themy', 1992);
console.log(themy); // Person(firstName:themy, birthYear:1992)

// When we use new to call the function 4 things happen;
1. New {} is created
2. function is called and this = {};
3. {} linked to the prototype
4. function automatically return {} 

prototypes
- each and every function in javascript has prototype


the proto of the object is the prototype of the constructor function
console.log(themy.__proto__ === Person.prototype) //true
