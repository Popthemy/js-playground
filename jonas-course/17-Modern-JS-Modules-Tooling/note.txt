- We write code in modules
- modules makes up packages which are available on the npm.
- npm is used to manage our packages and packages lives in them

The Build process produce the javascript bundle that will be sent to the browser for processing
- Bundling - it compresses our module into a single file and convert syntax to old syntax that browser can understand
- Transpiling/ polyfiling - using babel convert modern js syntax to Es5 so all browser can understand our language.
All these process is done using Webpack(requires configuration) and Parcel(doesn't require config)

Characteristics of module
- Compose Software, Abstraction , Isolation building, Reusability, Organized code

Difference between Module and scripts
                   Module                                  scripts
Variable        Top level variable                      Global scope
Default mode   Strict mode                                Sloppy mode
Top level this   undefined                                Window
import & Export   Yes                                     No
Html Linking   <script type='module'>                     <script>
file downloading Async                                    Sync (unless you use defer or async attribute)

Note: when working with module you have to specify type="module" when importing the scripts.
Type of import: Named import and Default import

use default: 1 per module(only when we want to export only one thing from a module)

Top-level await: when working with module we can now use await without the async but it does code blocking.

Module system in javascript
Es6 Module 
Moudule patter using IIFE
AMD modules Common JS module (but they are not natively js implementation )

npm install/ i - to install depencies
npm install package_name@version - install a particular version

you don't include the node modules as part of the files to be pushed to git 

Install parcel for dev : npm install parcel --save-dev (it a dev tool)
to bundle our module we can use: npx or use scripts
npx: npx parcel entry_file_name.Html
using script: include in the package.json scripts and you can run with npm run start( if start is the specified name)

to install a package globally use the flag -globally
