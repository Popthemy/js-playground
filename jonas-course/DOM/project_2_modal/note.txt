When we need to effect more style changes when a button is clicked we can 
include the style in a class and use js to add or remove these class using .classList() when we need it 

handling keyboard event (they are global event ) 
we listen on the whole document
Types of event for keyboard: 
 - key up: it happen when we lift our finger off the keyboard
 - key press: it happens when we continually press our hand on the keyboard
 - key down: happens when we press down on the key 

 Information about which key is pressed will be stored in the event object  when the event is occurs
  the object will contain the key tht was pressed and we can pass it as argument to the event listener.
